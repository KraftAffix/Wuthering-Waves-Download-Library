**Why is it a torrent if its from the official launcher?**
- The launcher has 4 CDN links to download each file and they give like 458+ links to download the game files seperately (no joke) unlike some _anime game_ that split the game into 4 zip files only requiring 4 links
- The torrent file also serves as a some kind of bulk download so you only have to download one file
